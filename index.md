# <b>About Me</b>

### Overview of Hacks, Study and Tangibles
Blogging in GitHub pages is a way to learn and code at the same time. 

- Plans, Lists, [Scrum Boards](https://clickup.com/blog/scrum-board/) help you to track key events, show progress and record time.  Effort is a big part of your class grade.  Show plans and time spent!
- [Hacks(Todo)](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/six-ultimate-daily-hacks-for-every-programmer-60f5f10feae) enable you to stay in focus with key requirements of the class.  Each Hack will produce Tangibles.
- Tangibles or [Tangible Artifacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(software_development)) are things you accumulate as a learner and coder.

<html><p><b>Hi, my name is Barbara. I speak English and Chinese. I like drawing, writing, sometimes graphic design, video games, editing, music, anime, and manga.</b></p></html>

## Sports

<html><p>Although I play tennis and badmintion, I don't really like sports that much. I like badmintion more than tennis though. Recently, I've had to take a break from sports and physical activity, due to some problems, so I guess technically I'm not playing any sports right now. I hope I can gain a deeper understanding of cs in this class.</p></html>

## Drawing
<html><p>I've been drawing for basically my whole life, and have entered multiple art competitions. I have dabbled with all sorts of mediums, although these days I mostly do digital art. </p></html>

## Editing
<html><p> As a mini hobby, I causally edit clips and photos of certain things. It involves syncing the media with music, adding transitions, effects, overlays, etc. I sometimes create videos too, although these things take a very long time to create. </p></html>

<html><p>Overall, I hope I can gain a deeper understanding of cs in this class. Thank you for reading. </p></html>
